     79 DFNB1 accounts for approximately 50% of congenital, severe-to-profound, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in the United States, France, Britain, and New Zealand/Australia [Denoyelle et al 1997, Green et al 1999]. Its approximate prevalence in the general population is 14:100,000, based on the following calculation: the incidence of congenital hereditary hearing impairment is 1:2000 neonates, of which 70% have nonsyndromic hearing loss. Seventy-five to 80% of cases of nonsyndromic hearing loss are autosomal recessive: of these, 50% result from GJB2 mutations. Thus, 5:10,000 x 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.5 = 14:100,000.

     19 MCPHA has been found primarily in the Old Order Amish who have ancestors in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. At least 61 affected infants have been born to 33 nuclear families in the past 40 years. In this population, incidence is approximately one in 500 births.    The report of Siu et al [2010] shows that the phenotype is not limited to the Old Order Amish population, although prevalence is difficult to estimate.

     14 1–2% of the population of infertile, but otherwise healthy, males and up to 25% of those with obstructive azoospermia. Among CBAVD patients, 78% had at least one CFTR mutation, 46% having two and 28% only one. Moreover, the common heterozygous F508del/5T and F508del/R117H were observed in 17 and 4% of CBAVD cases respectively.

     13 Familial hyperinsulinism has been reported in virtually all major ethnic groups. Prevalence has been estimated at 1:50,000 in the European population, whereas consanguineous populations of central Finland and Saudi Arabia have disease prevalence of approximately 1:2,500. The apparent increased prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews has not been rigorously studied.

     11 The overall prevalence of hereditary neuropathies is estimated at approximately 3:10,000 population. About 30% of these individuals (1:10,000) may have CMT2. The prevalence of the various subtypes of CMT2 is unknown
     11 CMT has a prevalence of 1 in 3,300, but mutations in DNM2 are a rare cause of CMT.

      2 Currently, CMT4A is considered the most frequent of all autosomal recessive forms of CMT.    Molecular genetic testing has shown that the following proportion of individuals with CMT have two disease-causing GDAP1 alleles:    1% - 15% individuals depending on the studied population
